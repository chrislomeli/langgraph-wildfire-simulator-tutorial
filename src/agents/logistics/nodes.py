world-simulator.agents.logistics.nodes

Node functions for the logistics agent ReAct loop.

Loop shape
──────────
    START → logistics_agent ──(tool calls?)──► tools → logistics_agent (repeat)
                             ──(no tool calls)──► extract_plan → END

  logistics_agent : AI boundary. Stub mode returns a placeholder AIMessage
                    with no tool calls so the loop exits immediately.
                    LLM mode calls the model with all three tools bound.
  extract_plan    : Terminal node — copies the LLM's final message content
                    into state.logistics_plan and marks COMPLETED.
  route_after_logistics_agent : Reads the last message; routes to "tools"
                    if tool_calls present, otherwise to "extract_plan".

Milestone flag
