Supervisor LangGraph — stub mode (dashboard milestone).

Topology
────────
    START
      → fan_out_to_clusters     (conditional edge — returns list[Send])
        → run_cluster_agent     (parallel, one per cluster)
      → assess_situation
      → run_logistics_agent     (ReAct subgraph: heatmap + resources + wildfire tools)
      → dispatch_commands → END

The Send API pattern
────────────────────
``fan_out_to_clusters`` returns a list of ``Send()`` objects. LangGraph
runs all of them in parallel, merges their results into the supervisor
state via the ``max_cluster_score`` and ``merge_cluster_findings`` reducers,
then advances to ``assess_situation``. This implicit synchronization barrier
is the key LangGraph skill these two graphs together demonstrate.

Why a separate supervisor graph?
─────────────────────────────────
The supervisor is the per-batch orchestrator (one invocation per tick).
The cluster agent is a worker subgraph (one invocation per cluster).
Splitting them keeps cluster state isolated for parallel execution and
lets the cluster subgraph be tested on its own.

Construction
────────────
``build_supervisor_graph`` is the only public entry point. It builds
the cluster subgraph internally, threading the registry and store down
into it, so callers configure dependencies once at the composition root
and the supervisor handles wiring its child graph.
