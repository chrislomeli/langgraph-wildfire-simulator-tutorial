"""agents.commons.risk_view

Read seam for per-cell fire-risk scores.

The asymmetry this closes
─────────────────────────
Risk is *written* through a seam: ``report_risk`` persists to the optional
``BaseStore`` and ``evaluate`` writes ``CellRiskAssessment`` onto the world
grid. But risk was *read* by scanning ``world_engine.grid`` inline inside
logistics ``sector_analysis``. That meant binding a persistent risk store
(needed by a stateless / Bedrock-style deployment where the orchestrator
keeps no in-memory world across invocations) could never actually feed
hotspot discovery — the writer had a seam, the reader did not.

``RiskView`` makes the read symmetric with the write. Hotspot discovery
goes through this interface. The in-memory ``GridRiskView`` binding scans
the grid exactly as the old inline loop did (zero behaviour change — the
one-shot demo is unaffected). A future persistent binding implements the
same Protocol with no change to ``sector_analysis``.
