Wildfire domain — stochastic fire spread on a terrain grid.

Public API:
  FireCellState              — per-cell state (terrain, fuel, fire status)
  FireEnvironmentState       — weather conditions (temp, humidity, wind)
  SimpleFirePhysicsModule    — heuristic fire spread model
  RothermelFirePhysicsModule — physics-based fire spread (Rothermel 1972)
  FuelModel / get_fuel_model — fuel load by terrain type
  NWCGResourceSpec           — NWCG-standard resource definitions
  Sensor classes             — temperature, smoke, humidity, wind, thermal
  Scenario factories         — create_basic_wildfire, create_full_wildfire_scenario
