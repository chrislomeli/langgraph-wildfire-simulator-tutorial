FireCellState — per-cell state for wildfire simulation.

This defines what data lives on each grid cell in a wildfire scenario:
  - terrain_type : what kind of land (forest, grassland, rock, etc.)
  - vegetation   : density of burnable material (0.0–1.0)
  - fuel_moisture: how wet the fuel is (0.0–1.0)
  - slope        : gradient in degrees
  - fire_state   : UNBURNED, BURNING, or BURNED
  - fire_intensity: how hot the fire is (0.0–1.0)
  - fire_start_tick: when the fire started in this cell

TerrainType and FireState enums are imported from world-simiulator.world.grid
(their original home) and re-exported here so that domain code can
import everything from one place.
