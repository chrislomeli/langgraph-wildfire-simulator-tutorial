world-simiulator.world.cell_state

Abstract base class for domain-specific cell states and a generic cell container.

CellState
─────────
Every physics domain defines a concrete subclass of CellState that declares
what data lives on each grid cell.  For example:

  - A wildfire domain defines FireCellState with fire_state, intensity, fuel.
  - An ocean domain defines OceanCellState with current, salinity, temperature.

The framework (grid, engine) never inspects the contents of a CellState —
that is the physics module's job.  The framework only calls summary_label()
for logging.

GenericCell
───────────
A lightweight container that pairs grid coordinates with a typed CellState.
Uses __slots__ because cells are inner-loop objects iterated every tick.
GenericCell is NOT a Pydantic model — keeping it as a plain class avoids
Pydantic v2 generic model pitfalls and keeps the hot path fast.
