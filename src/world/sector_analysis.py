world-simulator.world.sector_analysis

Radial sector analysis service over the world grid.

Purpose
───────
Given a fire hotspot (row, col) on a GenericTerrainGrid, this module
produces an 8-direction summary of what surrounds the hotspot: how far
the fire could spread before hitting a barrier, what stopped it, and
how the fuel/moisture/slope/wind look along the way.

This is a pure read-only analytical service over the grid — it has no
knowledge of agents, LangGraph state, messages, or LLMs. It used to
live inside `agents/logistics/nodes.py`; it was lifted here because:

  * It only reads the grid and produces summary records.
  * It is reusable: anything that wants a "compress the grid into
    sector summaries around a point" view can call it.
  * It belongs to the simulation/world layer's stated job of
    exposing grid views (see `world/__init__.py`).

Output shape
────────────
For a hotspot we return a `HotspotSectors` with:
  - epicenter_row, epicenter_col, risk_score, confidence
  - 8 `SectorSummary` records (one per cardinal/intercardinal direction)

Each `SectorSummary` contains:
  - direction, burnable_miles, stop_reason
  - avg_vegetation, avg_fuel_moisture, avg_slope, max_fire_intensity
  - wind_aligned (sector direction vs. wind direction)
  - cells_in_sector

The `stop_reason` is the load-bearing signal for downstream LLM prompts:
a 5-mile sector ending in WATER means the fire is bounded; the same
distance ending in URBAN means a settlement is in the spread path.

Coordinate convention matches `GenericTerrainGrid`:
  - row 0 = NORTH edge, increasing row = southward
  - col 0 = WEST edge, increasing col = eastward
