Abstract base class for domain-specific physics modules and the
StateEvent data class.

PhysicsModule
─────────────
The physics module is the pluggable heart of a domain.  It defines:

  - What the initial cell state looks like (initial_cell_state)
  - How the world evolves each tick (tick_physics)
  - How to summarise the grid for logging (summarize)

The engine calls tick_physics() each step and gets back a list of
StateEvents.  The engine applies those events to the grid.  The
physics module never mutates the grid directly — the engine is
always in control of state changes.

StateEvent
──────────
A lightweight dataclass that says "cell (row, col) should now have
this new_state."  The engine applies these after each tick.

StateEvent uses Generic[C] for type safety — a fire physics module
produces StateEvent[FireCellState], and the type checker ensures
you don't accidentally mix state types.

StateEvent is a dataclass, not a Pydantic model, because it's
internal plumbing that never crosses a serialisation boundary.
Keeping it lightweight matters — a single tick can produce many
state events.

class PhysicsModule(ABC, Generic[C]):
    """
    Abstract contract for domain physics.

    To implement a new domain:
      1. Define a CellState subclass (your domain's cell data)
      2. Define an EnvironmentState subclass (ambient conditions)
      3. Subclass PhysicsModule[YourCellState]
      4. Implement initial_cell_state, tick_physics, summarize
      5. Pass your physics module to GenericWorldEngine

    The module should be stateless between ticks — all state lives
    in the grid and environment.  This makes it safe to swap modules
    mid-simulation if needed (e.g. for A/B testing different models).
