GenericWorldEngine — the domain-agnostic simulation tick loop.

What this does
──────────────
The GenericWorldEngine is the central coordinator.  Each tick:

  1. Environment evolves (tick on EnvironmentState).
  2. Physics module runs (computes StateEvents for cell changes).
  3. StateEvents are applied to the grid.
  4. Ground truth snapshot is recorded.

The engine does NOT:
  - Know what domain it's simulating (fire, ocean, disease, etc.).
  - Interpret cell states or environment values.
  - Know about Kafka, LangGraph, or agents.
  - Publish events to any bus.
  - Run sensors automatically.

Sensors are separate objects managed by SensorInventory.  They
read from the grid/environment when they need a measurement.

Ground truth
────────────
After every tick, the engine records a GenericGroundTruthSnapshot:
  - Environment conditions at that tick
  - What state changes happened (as dicts)
  - A domain-specific summary from the physics module

This is the "answer key" for evaluating agent decisions.
The agent never sees ground truth — it only sees sensor readings.

Reproducibility
───────────────
Set a random seed before running the engine for deterministic results.
This is essential for comparing agent configurations and regression testing.
