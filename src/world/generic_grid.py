GenericTerrainGrid — a domain-agnostic 3D grid of GenericCell objects.

What this is
────────────
The spatial backbone of the simulation.  Each cell has coordinates
(row, col, layer) and a typed CellState that the physics module owns.
The grid knows about topology (neighbors, bounds, iteration) but never
interprets cell state — that is the physics module's job.

Coordinate system
─────────────────
(row, col, layer) where row 0 is the NORTH edge, col 0 is the WEST
edge, and layer 0 is the ground/surface level.  Higher layers are
above, though the physical meaning of layers is domain-defined.

When layers=1 (the default), the grid behaves like a 2D grid with
all layer parameters defaulting to 0.

Construction
────────────
The grid takes an initial_state_factory callable (typically
physics.initial_cell_state) that creates the starting CellState
for each cell.  This means the grid doesn't need to know what
domain it's in — the factory injects the domain.

State changes
─────────────
All cell state changes go through update_cell_state().  The engine
calls this after receiving StateEvents from the physics module.
Nothing else should mutate cell state — this enforces the
"physics returns events, engine applies them" contract.
